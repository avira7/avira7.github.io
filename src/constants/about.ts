  bio: `I am a <u>physicist</u> with a background in both computational and experimental approaches.
        I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the <strong>Georgia Institute of Technology</strong>, where I simulated 
        radiation shielding composites to optimize its internal structure and analyzed Apollo rocks 
        at an atomic-scale using scanning transmission electron microscopy.<br><br>

        Before graduate school, I worked at <strong>Los Alamos National Laboratory</strong> in the 
        space division on near-Earth satellites and at the <strong>Harvard-Smithsonian Center 
        for Astrophysics</strong> on infrared spectroscopy for the solar eclipse. I received my 
        B.A. in Physics and Mathematics from <strong>Smith College</strong>.`,
